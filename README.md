# Tribute Page: John Cleese

Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design Certification project

A very simple tribute page for the great John Cleese. I completed this several years ago; however, I decided I wanted a copy on GitHub as well as CodePen.

Toolbox:

- HTML5
- CSS (No Sass! Kept it painfully basic)
